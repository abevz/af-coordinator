# Installing dibs

The `v0.1.0-rc.4` preview is published for Linux amd64/arm64 and macOS
Intel/Apple Silicon. Use its versioned URL: GitHub's `latest` URL selects
stable releases and does not select this prerelease.

## Linux and macOS release installation

Install the published preview:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/abevz/dibs/releases/download/v0.1.0-rc.4/install.sh | sh /dev/stdin
```

The downloaded script carries the release tag that supplied it, and fetches the
archive and checksum manifest for that same tag. It selects Linux amd64/arm64
or macOS Intel/Apple Silicon, verifies the archive, and installs `dibs`,
`dibsd`, and `dibs-mcp` in `~/.local/bin` without sudo. It installs the Apache-2.0
license at `~/.local/share/licenses/dibs/LICENSE`. The script prints a PATH
hint when that directory is not available in the current shell.

To inspect the exact script before running it:

```sh
curl -fsSL -o install.sh https://github.com/abevz/dibs/releases/download/v0.1.0-rc.4/install.sh
less install.sh
sh install.sh
```

To install a specific published version, download its script from that tag:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/abevz/dibs/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/install.sh | sh /dev/stdin
```

Replace `vX.Y.Z` with a release tag. Repeating the installer replaces the three
program binaries and preserves the daemon database and local state. Installing
a different tag updates or downgrades only those binaries; check compatibility
with the existing database before a downgrade. To inspect the running client
version, use `dibs version`, and use `dibs doctor` after the daemon is running.

The installer does not switch an already running service to a new binary. A
service switch or restart is an explicit operator action described in
[operations](operations.md#explicit-service-switch). Existing installations
using the former `af-coordinator` paths keep their existing canonical database.

## First use

Run `dibs init` inside a Git repository. It displays the detected project,
repository, worktree, and branch, starts `dibsd` when needed, registers the
mapping, and adds the managed agent instructions to the repository's
`AGENTS.md`. Repeating `dibs init` is safe. Example after installation:

```sh
cd your-repository
dibs init
dibs issue create --project your-repository --scope-kind project --title "First task"
dibs issue claim your-repository-1 --holder "$USER"
```

Use the project key shown by `init` in the latter commands. If Git cannot
unambiguously identify the project or default branch, `init` asks for
`--project`, `--repo`, or `--default-branch`. For an inspectable preview without
writing files or starting the daemon, run `dibs init --dry-run`.

`dibs daemon start` and `dibs daemon stop` control a daemon started by dibs.
For a systemd or launchd managed daemon, stop it with its service manager;
`daemon stop` refuses to signal a manager-owned process.
The daemon uses the existing database path, including the legacy path when
present. Startup errors are shown with the daemon log path. Service-manager
setups remain available for users who want them.

## Remove binaries

Stop a running daemon first, using the applicable commands in
[operations](operations.md). For the default release installation directory:

```sh
rm "$HOME/.local/bin/dibs" "$HOME/.local/bin/dibsd" "$HOME/.local/bin/dibs-mcp"
rm "$HOME/.local/share/licenses/dibs/LICENSE"
```

The installer creates only the three canonical binaries. During upgrades it
removes old `afctl`, `af-coordinatord`, and `afc-mcp` symlinks only when they
still point to the corresponding dibs binaries. Independent files are kept. The database, backups,
configuration, and logs stay on disk so removal of the programs does not
discard work.

## Homebrew

If Homebrew is already installed, the preview is available from the
[dibs tap](https://github.com/abevz/homebrew-dibs):

```sh
brew install abevz/dibs/dibs
```

This installs `dibs`, `dibsd`, and `dibs-mcp` on Linux amd64/arm64 and macOS
Intel/Apple Silicon. Run `dibs init` in a Git repository afterward. To receive
a newer version when the tap is updated, run `brew update` followed by
`brew upgrade abevz/dibs/dibs`. `brew uninstall abevz/dibs/dibs` removes the
programs while retaining the database and configuration. If you have also
used the shell installer, `command -v dibs` shows which binary your shell runs.
Stop a running daemon before upgrading or uninstalling, then start it again
after an upgrade. For a manager-owned daemon, use its service manager as
described in [operations](operations.md#explicit-service-switch).

## Install with Go

For Go users, this version-pinned source install was checked on Linux amd64
with Go 1.27.1:

```sh
go install github.com/abevz/dibs/cmd/dibs@v0.1.0-rc.4 \
  github.com/abevz/dibs/cmd/dibsd@v0.1.0-rc.4 \
  github.com/abevz/dibs/cmd/dibs-mcp@v0.1.0-rc.4
```

The binaries go to `GOBIN`, or to `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` when `GOBIN` is unset.
Put that directory on `PATH` before running `dibs init`. This build reports
`dibs dev (unknown)` because `go install` does not inject the version and
revision that the release workflow embeds. Use the release installer or Homebrew for the tested
binary distribution on all four supported platforms. AUR instructions remain
pending verification.

## Update release binaries

Release installations keep `dibs`, `dibsd`, and `dibs-mcp` in the existing
installation directory (default `~/.local/bin`, or installer `BINDIR`). Check
without changing binaries or restarting the daemon:

```sh
dibs update --check
```

Exit codes are **0** for no newer release, **10** for an available update, and
**1** for a failed check. The output compares installed/latest versions and
shows intervening CHANGELOG sections, with breaking changes first. Stable
versions select stable releases; an installed prerelease also considers
prereleases. `--prerelease` explicitly includes prereleases for a stable build.
Source builds reporting `dev` cannot check or self-update; install a published
release first.

```sh
dibs update                     # prompts for breaking changes and daemon restart
# For unattended use, migrate consumers first:
dibs update --yes               # accepts breaking changes; does not authorize restart
dibs update --yes --restart      # separately authorizes daemon restart
dibs update --rollback           # restore retained binaries without network
```

The updater verifies the existing release archive against `checksums.txt`
before changing binaries. Existing public binary paths become symlinks through
a shared `.dibs-update/current` pointer inside the same installation directory.
One atomic pointer replacement publishes all three binaries. Previous binaries
remain in `.dibs-update` for rollback; a failed download, checksum, or later
upgrade leaves the current installation and its rollback target intact. The
existing license location stays in place, and each verified generation also
retains its release license. Homebrew installations (including resolved Cellar paths) and independently
managed symlinks are refused: use
`brew upgrade abevz/dibs/dibs` for that installation.

A running daemon keeps its old executable until explicitly restarted. Use
`--restart` or accept the separate restart prompt for the installed systemd or
launchd service; otherwise restart using [operations](operations.md). A failed
restart reports an error and leaves rollback available. Updates and rollbacks
never open or migrate the coordinator database, change its path, or rewrite
service configuration. Database/schema changes remain a separate operation.

The daemon refreshes release metadata in the background at most once per
24 hours, with an eight-second timeout; it never upgrades binaries. Ordinary
CLI commands read only `$XDG_STATE_HOME/dibs/update.json` (default
`~/.local/state/dibs/update.json`) and never wait on release network requests.
A cached newer version produces one stderr line after normal terminal output,
at most once per 24 hours per version, or a footer in interactive `dibs watch` (`--once` uses stderr). JSON, hooks,
MCP, and `issue run` children suppress it. Disable notices with:

```sh
export DIBS_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1
```
